Story: Create a prompt

As a personal metrics nerd
I order to collect interesting data.
I want to create a recurring prompt

Given there a no prompts
When I create a prompt
Then I should receive a prompt a the times I set


Story: Answer a prompt

Given a prompt
When I enter data
Then data is output

Story: View data

Given data
When I view the data page
Then I see the data


What about when answer prompt, that triggers a port,
you can connect different adapters to it, for example output to google sheet.
