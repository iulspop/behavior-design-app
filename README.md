## Development ðŸ› 

### Getting Started

- Make sure you're using Node.js 18.0.0 or higher. You can run:

  ```sh
  node -v
  ```

  to check which version you're on.

- Install dependencies:

  ```sh
  npm i
  ```

- Make sure your system can run the Husky hooks (Mac & Linux):

  ```sh
  chmod a+x .husky/pre-commit
  ```

- Create a `.env` file and add these environment variables (see `.env.example`,
  too):

  - `MAGIC_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `MAGIC_SECRET_KEY` - You'll need to grab a
    public key and a secret key for your project from your
    [Magic dashboard](https://magic.link). Use a Magic app only used for testing and development.
  - `SESSION_SECRET` - The session secret can be any string that is at least 32
    characters long.
  - `DATABASE_URL` - The url under which the SQLite database will operate. You
    may use the value from `.env.example` for this.

- Add a `console.warn` to `getUserIdFromSession()` in
  `app/features/user-authentication/user-authentication-session.server.ts`:

  ```ts
  const getUserIdFromSession = (session: Session): string | undefined => {
    const userId = session.get(USER_SESSION_KEY);
    console.warn('userId', userId);
    return userId;
  };
  ```

- Set up the database:

  ```sh
  npm run prisma:setup
  ```

- Start dev server:

  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

- Sign up for an account under `/login` by logging in with Magic.

- Grab the `userId` that you logged out in the previous step from the terminal
  in which you ran `npm run dev` and add it to your `.env` file as
  `SEED_USER_ID`.

- Remove the `console.warn` from `getUserIdFromSession()`.

- Now you can add the remaining values to your `.env` file, which are used by
  the main seed script:

  - `SEED_USER_ID` - The steps above outlined how to get this value. This value
    is the user id of the user that will be seeded in the database. This value
    is required for the `"prisma:seed"` script.

- Lastly, stop your `npm run dev` script and run

  ```sh
  npm run prisma:reset-dev
  ```

  , which wipes the database, seeds the database with lots of data and starts up
  the dev server again.

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

### Prisma helper scripts

- `"prisma:apply-changes"` - Applies changes to the database schema to the
  database.
- `"prisma:seed"` - Seeds the database with a user profile.
- `"prisma:setup"` - Sets up the database.
- `"prisma:wipe"` - Wipes the database (irrevocably delete all data, but keep
  the schema).
- `"prisma:reset-dev"` - Wipes the database, seeds it and starts the dev server.
  This is a utility script that you can use in development to get clean starts.

### Generating boilerplate

This repository uses [Plop](https://plopjs.com/documentation/#getting-started)
to automate the generation of common boilerplate.

Run `npm run gen` and then choose what you want to create, e.g.:

```
$ npm run gen

> gen
> plop

? What do you want to generate? React component
? For what feature do you want to generate the React component? user profile
? What is the name of the React component? user name
âœ”  ++ /app/features/user-profile/user-name-component.tsx
âœ”  ++ /app/features/user-profile/user-name-component.test.tsx
```

Out of the box, there are three options:

- React component with unit test
- Database model utils
- E2E tests for a route

## Testing ðŸ§ª

### Playwright ðŸŽ­

> **Note:** make sure you've run `npm run dev` at least one time before you run
> the E2E tests!

We use Playwright for our End-to-End tests in this project. You'll find those in
the `playwright/` directory. As you make changes to your app, add to an existing
file or create a new file in the `playwright/e2e` directory to test your
changes.

[Playwright natively features testing library selectors](https://playwright.dev/docs/release-notes#locators)
for selecting elements on the page semantically.

To run these tests in development, run `npm run test:e2e` which will start the
dev server for the app as well as the Playwright client.

#### Utilities

We have a utility for testing authenticated features without having to go
through the login flow:

```ts
test('something that requires an authenticated user', async ({ page }) => {
  await loginByCookie({ page });
  // ... your tests ...
});
```

Check out the `playwright/utils.ts` file for other utility functions.

## CI/CD

GitHub actions is configured to run tests and deploy to [fly.io](fly.io) on every commit to the main branch.

The following GitHub repository secrets must be set:

- `DATABASE_URL` same as `.env`

- `FLY_API_TOKEN`. Go to your user settings on Fly and create a new [token](https://web.fly.io/user/personal_access_tokens/new), then add it to [your repo secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) with the name `FLY_API_TOKEN`.

- `MAGIC_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `MAGIC_SECRET_KEY` use the credentials for the Magic app used for testing and development.

- `SESSION_SECRET` same as `.env`

## Deployment

A Docker image is built and deployed to [fly.io](fly.io).

### Initial Deployment

Prior to your first deployment, you'll need to do a few things:

- [Install Fly](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/installing-flyctl/)

- Sign up and log in to Fly

  ```sh
  fly auth signup
  ```

  > **Note:** If you have more than one Fly account, ensure that you are signed into the same account in the Fly CLI as you are in the browser. In your terminal, run `fly auth whoami` and ensure the email matches the Fly account signed into the browser.

- Create the app on Fly:

  ```sh
  fly apps create
  ```

  > **Note:** The app name is taken from the `app` set in your `fly.toml` file.

- Add a `SESSION_SECRET` to your Fly app secrets, to do this you can run the following commands:

  ```sh
  fly secrets set SESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
  ```

  If you don't have openssl installed, you can also use [1password](https://1password.com/password-generator/) to generate a random secret, just replace `$(openssl rand -hex 32)` with the generated secret.

- Add your production Magic app `MAGIC_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `MAGIC_SECRET_KEY` credentials to your Fly app secrets.

- Create a persistent volume for the sqlite database. Run the following:

  ```sh
  fly volumes create data --size 1
  ```

### Subsequent Deployments

The app is continuously deployed on every commit. However, you can deploy manually using `fly deploy`.

### Testing Docker Container

The Docker image is used only for deploying on Fly and isn't used in development. However you can test it by building the image and starting the container locally.

Build image and name it:

```sh
docker build -t inquire_image .
```

Start the container with the port open:

```sh
docker run -i -t -e MAGIC_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="x" \
-e MAGIC_SECRET_KEY="x" \
-e SESSION_SECRET="x" \
-p 8080:8080 \
--name inquire_container inquire_image
```

The env variables must be set or the error `Invariant Failed` will be thrown by `remix-serve build`.

### Debugging Deployment

Fly deployment throwing a `"Failed due to unhealthy allocations"` might be because secrets are not set correctly on the Fly app. See [Troubleshooting your Deployment](https://fly.io/docs/getting-started/troubleshooting/) for more troubleshooting options.
