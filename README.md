# Inquire

## Getting Started

- Make sure you're using Node.js 18.0.0 or higher. You can run:

  ```sh
  node -v
  ```

  to check which version you're on.

- Install dependencies:

  ```sh
  npm i
  ```

- Make sure your system can run the Husky hooks (Mac & Linux):

  ```sh
  chmod a+x .husky/pre-commit
  ```

- Create a `.env` file and add these environment variables (see `.env.example`,
  too):

  - `MAGIC_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` and `MAGIC_SECRET_KEY` - You'll need to grab a
    public key and a secret key for your project from your
    [Magic dashboard](https://magic.link). Use a Magic app only used for testing and development.
  - `SESSION_SECRET` - The session secret can be any string that is at least 32
    characters long.
  - `DATABASE_URL` - The url under which the SQLite database will operate. You
    may use the value from `.env.example` for this.

- Add a `console.warn` to `getUserIdFromSession()` in
  `app/features/user-authentication/user-authentication-session.server.ts`:

  ```ts
  const getUserIdFromSession = (session: Session): string | undefined => {
    const userId = session.get(USER_SESSION_KEY);
    console.warn('userId', userId);
    return userId;
  };
  ```

- Set up the database:

  ```sh
  npm run db:setup
  ```

- Start dev server:

  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

- Sign up for an account under `/login` by logging in with Magic.

- Grab the `userId` that you logged out in the previous step from the terminal
  in which you ran `npm run dev` and add it to your `.env` file as
  `SEED_USER_ID`.

- Remove the `console.warn` from `getUserIdFromSession()`.

- Now you can add the remaining values to your `.env` file, which are used by
  the main seed script:

  - `SEED_USER_ID` - The steps above outlined how to get this value. This value
    is the user id of the user that will be seeded in the database. This value
    is required for the `"db:seed"` script.

- Lastly, stop your `npm run dev` script and run

  ```sh
  npm run db:reset-dev
  ```

  , which wipes the database, seeds the database with lots of data and starts up
  the dev server again.

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.
